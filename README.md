AI-Career Training 🚀

This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming an AI/ML Engineer.
It contains hands-on notebooks covering Python fundamentals, Pandas for data analysis, advanced transformations, visualizations, and mini-projects.

The repo is organized into modules, each building on the previous one — moving from basics → advanced analytics → projects → visualization → SQL/ML.

📚 Learning Roadmap

🟢 Module 1: Python Foundations (python_basics/)
	•	Python syntax essentials: variables, conditionals, loops, functions
	•	Data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
	•	File I/O, error handling, formatting
	•	Mini Project: Quiz App with score tracking

⸻

🟢 Module 2: Data Wrangling with Pandas (pandas_fundamentals/)
	•	Loading & inspecting datasets (.read_csv, .info, .describe)
	•	Filtering rows & selecting columns (.loc, .iloc, boolean masks)
	•	Handling missing values (.isnull, .dropna, .fillna)
	•	Sorting, ranking, and aggregation with .groupby()
	•	Case Study: Titanic dataset (survival by gender, class, and age)

⸻

🟢 Module 3: Advanced Pandas (pandas_advanced/)
	•	Reshaping data: pivot, pivot_table, melt
	•	Long vs. wide formats (stack, unstack)
	•	Rolling averages & moving form trackers (.rolling, .transform)
	•	Lag, diff, and percentage change (.shift, .diff, .pct_change)
	•	Points systems and custom ranking logic
	•	Weighted points with stage multipliers (Group, Quarter, Semi, Final)
	•	Champions League Analysis:
	•	Standings tables with GD, points, rank
	•	Win streaks & rolling averages
	•	Top scorers with explode + groupby
	•	Opponent matrices (stack vs. unstack)

⸻

🟢 Module 4: Projects (projects/)
	•	Titanic Analysis: Pandas + visualization for survival analysis
	•	Champions League Project (Kaggle UEFA dataset):
	•	Full pipeline: standings, scorers, weighted points, country stats
	•	Visualizations: barplots, scatterplots, heatmaps
	•	Exported figures + textual summary
	•	Retail Pipeline (AOV & Top-K Analysis): customer purchase behavior

⸻

🟡 Module 5: Visualization (in progress, visualization/)
	•	Matplotlib + Seaborn for storytelling
	•	Bar charts, histograms, KDE plots
	•	Comparative charts: survival by class, gender, age
	•	Champions League dashboard: standings + scorers visualization

⸻

🏆 Key Skills Learned
	•	Python: functions, loops, dictionaries, file handling
	•	Pandas: groupby, pivot/melt, apply, rolling, transform, merge, crosstab
	•	Data Wrangling: missing data handling, normalization, ranking, weighted metrics
	•	Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn (multi-plot dashboards, heatmaps, comparisons)
	•	GitHub Workflow: version control, structured repo, consistent commits

⸻

📌 Next Steps
	•	Wrap up visualization recap
	•	Start SQL bootcamp (10 days) for database querying
	•	Transition into Machine Learning projects (classification, regression, model evaluation)
